# Ionic2Do
Source Code for Mobile App Development with Ionic 2

This is a starter template for the Ionic2Do app from [Mobile App Development with Ionic 2](http://www.ionic2book.com/) published by O'Reilly.

## How to use this template

*This template does not work on its own*.

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic start Ionic2Do blank
$ cd Ionic2Do
```

Once you have created the starter Ionic application using the steps above, download this repo and copy over the src and www directories into the newly created folder, replacing the initial src and www directory. You will still need to follow any additional steps in the book.
